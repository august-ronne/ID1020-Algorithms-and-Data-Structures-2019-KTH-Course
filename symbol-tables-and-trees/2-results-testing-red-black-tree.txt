    Storing every word and its number of occurrences asa key-value pair in a red black BST
    and then finding the most frequently occurring word took 485730141 nanoseconds.
    The most frequently occurring word was [the] with 8230 occurrences.

    Process finished with exit code 0

    10 test runs gave an average execution time of ~ 490 000 000 nanoseconds.
    This is approximately 20 % faster than the Binary Search Ordered Array structure, and
    the same speed as the BST.
